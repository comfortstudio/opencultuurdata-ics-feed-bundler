For a few nights, this dead building which had been empty for years was lit with life again. That fall, it really felt like something might change. But a little over 2 weeks later, the municipality of Amsterdam excercized its power and exorcized Hotel Mokum for vacancy - proving once again that for them, the right to own property outweighs the right to live.\n\nOne year, one energy- and one inflation crisis later, Hotel Mokum remains empty while the city seems about to collapse under its own weight, making all kinds of sounds in the process. People who were already struggling to afford sleep and eat can no longer afford to heat - coming winter will be a harsh one, indeed. And all this time, while these poor souls are cold and hungry, the speculators and patriarchs of the ruins like Peter Hagedoorn leave empty buildings to decay all over the city. This must stop; demand housing justice now!\n\nThis is why Mokum Kraakt has squatted the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 302 on 20.10.2022 and renamed it The Monument in an attempt to breathe new life into this abandoned house. In celebration of this resurrected ruin joining the realm of the living once again after years of neglect, Mokum Kraakt invites you to the exhibition Piep Knars Krijs Kraak.\n\n-\n\nFrom Friday, 28.10.-Sunday, 30-10 at The Monument (Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 302), Mokum Kraakt is organizing Piep Knars Krijs Kraak, an exhibition with 13 contributions by different artists and activists that are looking for ways in which (cheap!) art and culture can continue to exist in a city that's cracking at the seems. The participants were chosen from over 120 applications to an open call the collective published in August of this year. The exhibition is funded by the Creative Industries Fund NL.\n\nWith contributions by Ben Maier, Dario di Paolantonio, Lina Selg, Daniel Dmyszewicz, Femke Dekker, Heleen Mineur, Lily Lanfermeijer, Sm\u00e1ri R\u00fanar R\u00f3bertsson, N\u00edna Harra, Lisette Olsthoorn, Nadezhda Bakhshieva, Nezhla Imanzadeh, Pablo Rezzonico, Paul Bille, Repelsteeltje, Victoria Hoogstoel, and We Sell Reality.

The distinction between the virtual and 'real life' no longer applies, or perhaps was never really there. Their effects (or should we say affects?) are moving through digital infrastructures, policy, regulations, and bodies. If memes are used as a tool by the alt-right to mobilize people to storm the Capitol and play a substantial role in the Ukrainian war, can they also be used by the left to spark a revolution, as memetic warfare is more immediate and accessible than real-life demonstrations? What kind of labor would that require? What kind of tools and principles would we need? And what if memetic logics of spreading information were applied to spread progressive ideas for a possible future?\n\nOn the 11th of November, INC invites various theorists, researchers, journalists, activists, designers, and other creatives and thinkers to critically reflect on the tacticality of memes. During a one-day conference at Spui25, we dive into meme activism &amp; political warfare, meme design &amp; labor, and speculative memes &amp; imaginaries. The Memes Beyond the Image Conference is also the launch of the Critical Meme Reader #2: Memetic Tacticality, which is edited by Chlo\u00eb Arkenbout and Laurence Scherz.\n\nThis conference is free of charge, takes place at Spui25 in Amsterdam, and is also live-streamed.\n\nRegister here: https:\/\/spui25.nl\/programma\/memes-beyond-images\nProgram\n\n Introduction by Chlo\u00eb Arkenbout and Laurence Scherz\n\nMeme Activism &amp; Political Warfare\n\n The Power of Cuteness and the Cuteness of Power: Fandom Governance in China within the Covid-19 Crisis, by Jamie Wong\n Russian Digital Warfare Narratives (and Counter-Narratives) on TikTok: On Propaganda in Hyper-Affective and Ambiguous Spaces, by Marloes Geboers and Elena Pilipets\n Benevolent Edgelords: Specters of Benjamin and Memetic Ambiguity, by Pierre d'Alancaisez\n\nMeme Design &amp; Labor\n\n Strategies for Situating Memes in Physical Contexts, interview with Cem A.

Her dissertation analyzes an emergent synergy between the Chinese government's leveraging of the nation's vast scale as a policy resource and venture capital (VC) investors' 'moonshot' approach to business. She also studies the implications of China's internet culture and digital economy for governance and civil discourse.\n\n----\n\nThis project was funded with the help of the Centre of Experience for Creative Innovation.","link":"https:\/\/spui25.nl\/programma\/memes-beyond-images","source":"https:\/\/networkcultures.org\/events.ics"},{"uid":"3bf6196b-678b-42bd-b4ad-2abae71dcd2d","start":"01-04-2021 00:00","end":"01-05-2021 00:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"Notes by eva susova","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"14eba514-57fb-4197-b95f-5f40cde4549c","start":"01-02-2021 17:00","end":"28-02-2021 12:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"(G)HOSTING: TOWARDS A RECESSIONAL AESTHETICS by Mitchel Cumming","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"2675480f-bc96-406f-a4c7-0ee187c3abe2","start":"30-05-2022 13:00","end":"29-06-2022 14:00","location":"www.misted.cc","organizer":null,"title":"Inflammations by Ania Nowak","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"d25d0907-5e2a-4015-9cc2-885e202d9d11","start":"01-03-2021 10:00","end":"31-03-2021 12:00","location":"https:\/\/misted.cc","organizer":null,"title":"\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (pharmakon, the poison and the cure) by Simon Asencio","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"de0779f1-7aff-4d6b-bec7-bad6d7a6d6fc","start":"01-05-2022 00:00","end":"30-05-2022 00:00","location":"www.misted.cc","organizer":null,"title":"Some where we stay, a collective bruise, a team, a time spent together, a choreographic spell, a prefatory charm, a sensation that nothing that comes out of my mouth, fingers, keyboard, mother tongue, language,  is mine  by Alix Eynaudi","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"6870adbe-cc9f-41bd-9e93-4c28fa1da91e","start":"01-07-2021 00:00","end":"01-08-2021 00:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"Words, words, words are decorative sounds by Giovanni Giaretta","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"72f1684d-2766-474a-950f-e6d708d449c1","start":"01-05-2021 00:00","end":"01-06-2021 00:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"Animator Pt. 1 by Artun Alaska Arasli","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"ee1a2f52-8a98-4cc2-a046-cbcdb0c81004","start":"01-06-2021 00:00","end":"01-07-2021 00:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"The Agent by Chloe Chignell, Stefan Govaart & Alice Heyward","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/nx7814.your-storageshare.de\/remote.php\/dav\/public-calendars\/DEpJafeAt4YfD7HT?export"},{"uid":"4und12qe3gjs2le1mfaad2aigg@google.com","start":"14-12-2021 15:00","end":"14-12-2021 16:00","location":"https:\/\/us02web.zoom.us\/j\/88612646883?pwd=Q05KZUZmanNLTDJmSzBKcy84TDlGZz09","organizer":null,"title":"mistral -

Perpetual Finales offers a sonic contemplation on endings, closures, finales and, perhaps, anticlimaxes. A finale in and of itself, it sonifies the third part in mistral's summer hangouts, and indeed, the last week of summer 2020. <br><br>This collective collection for mistral also marks the third part of a series of shows by Youset (Yousef Anastas, Radio Alhara co-founder). The first part was made up of sonic 'beginnings', overtures and openings, and the second consisted of a selection sonifying 'thresholds' and other in-between states. Perpetual Finales traverses manifold interpretations of and associations with the idea of a 'finale': as a conclusion, a breaking point, catharsis, relief... or as unresolved, gridlocked, not ready to let go... <br><br>Perpetual Finales will be audible in a trio of locales: through Radio Alhara, broadcasting live from Bethlehem, Palestine; through Ja Ja Ja Nee Nee Nee, broadcasting live from Amsterdam; and on-site at mistral's physical space. <br><br>For those who'd like to come by this Thursday, we have decided that the system of working with reservations - although crude and exclusive in a practical way - worked well to keep all of us as safe as possible, and even generated an interesting sense of intimacy. For this reason, we will continue to do so for this last hangout.<br><br>The (still informal) hangout will consist of 2 time slots:<br><br>1. 17.00 - 18.30<br>2. 18.30 - 20.00<br><br>During both time slots drinks and a light meal will be available (based on donation, please bring cash). All proceeds of this evening will be donated to Beirut's Musician Fund.<br><br> Please make a reservation by e-mail to info@mistral.amsterdam - mentioning 'rsvp 17 sept' and what time you prefer.<br><br> Capacity is limited, but you can also listen from home or elsewhere to the live radio broadcast. A  recording will be shared afterwards at our website.<br><br>*In case you have any (mild) symptoms that could relate to covid-19, or have travelled to a risk country in the last 14 days, please stay home for now and we hope to welcome you again in the future.<br><br><a href=https:\/\/yamakan.place\/palestine\/?fbclid=IwAR180V8RWTXWQnh--7DPYpZbcbNnSC0lP1lyQB2FWNUoRdfPetGuYkg-BH0>https:\/\/yamakan.place\/palestine\/<\/a><br><a href=https:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjajajaneeneenee.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR180V8RWTXWQnh--7DPYpZbcbNnSC0lP1lyQB2FWNUoRdfPetGuYkg-BH0&amp;h=AT1bGJvVgUs_x4QSVDf6icSAsyQ9tJYNWNiok8azu_NARtt26FMJ3PUMMnSMZxCAtLVWE2iimqyK4BlOSvVhhj7oD8osMr7LDuSnz8tMQJcrTRaUIcob0M2oshi7DdQ9fjzNGwE>https:\/\/jajajaneeneenee.com\/<\/a><\/span><\/i><\/span>","link":"https:\/\/yamakan.place\/palestine\/?fbclid=IwAR180V8RWTXWQnh--7DPYpZbcbNnSC0lP1lyQB2FWNUoRdfPetGuYkg-BH0>https:\/\/yamakan.place\/palestine\/<\/a><br><a href=https:\/\/l.facebook.com\/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjajajaneeneenee.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR180V8RWTXWQnh--7DPYpZbcbNnSC0lP1lyQB2FWNUoRdfPetGuYkg-BH0&amp;h=AT1bGJvVgUs_x4QSVDf6icSAsyQ9tJYNWNiok8azu_NARtt26FMJ3PUMMnSMZxCAtLVWE2iimqyK4BlOSvVhhj7oD8osMr7LDuSnz8tMQJcrTRaUIcob0M2oshi7DdQ9fjzNGwE>https:\/\/jajajaneeneenee.com\/<\/a><\/span><\/i><\/span>","source":"https:\/\/calendar.google.com\/calendar\/ical\/mistral.amsterdam20@gmail.com\/public\/basic.ics"},{"uid":"03ado43v4omh3saoq6425kqq7r@google.com","start":"04-09-2020 15:00","end":"04-09-2020 18:00","location":"mistral, Pakhuis Wilhelmina, Veemkade 576, Amsterdam","organizer":null,"title":"summer hangouts w\/ Amal Alhaag","description":"<span>During August and September, we invite you for a series of summer hangouts: during these 'soft openings' everyone is welcome to the space, to have a drink and some food together and mark these new beginnings.

That's the transformation Guerilla Toss trace on their newest album Famously Alive, their effervescent Sub Pop debut. After a decade sprinkling glitter into grit, building a reputation as one of the most ferociously creative art-rock groups working, the upstate New York band have eased fully into their light. This is Guerilla Toss at their most luminescent - awake, alive, and extending an open invitation to anyone who wants to soak it all up beside them.\n\nSinger and lyricist Kassie Carlson, multi-instrumentalist Peter Negroponte and guitarist Arian Shafiee wrote Famously Alive at home in the Catskills during the pervading quiet of the pandemic year. The uncertainty of COVID-19 lockdowns and the total disruption of routine forced Carlson to negotiate with herself in new and challenging ways. You have to be with yourself all the time during the pandemic, she says. I had to figure out a way to manage my anxiety. The pandemic was hard, but it helped me get comfortable inside my own body. My peace of mind came out of being thrust into the deepest shit. This album is all about being happy, being alive, and strength. It's meant to inspire people.\n\nThe album's title derives from a poem written by a close friend of the band, Jonny Tatelman, who supported Carlson through the early stages of her recovery from opiate addiction. The poem comprises the entirety of the lyrics to the title track, an exuberant ode to loving your own survival and charting a course into unconditional self-acceptance. The song 'Famously Alive' is about living with purpose and excitement whether you're famous or not, accepting your strangeness and thriving even if your successes look different than other people's, notes Carlson. To me, 'Famously Alive' means flipping the notion of dying famously to living famously, Negroponte adds. I also like to think of it as a way to describe living through something traumatic and coming out of it a stronger, wiser person.\n\nSongs like the expansive, gleaming Live Exponential similarly invite the listener to lean into the light. It's about loving yourself and finding a way to be comfortable in your own body - to live life to the fullest and beyond, says Carlson. Throughout the record, Guerilla Toss meet themselves with curiosity, generosity, and acceptance even for the harder parts of being alive. Opener Cannibal Capital, a song about the exhaustion and dread of social anxiety, came together in a flurry toward the end of the album's sessions. A taut bass groove erupts into competing squalls of guitar and synth that support one of the most immediate and arresting vocal hooks of Guerilla Toss's catalog to date.\n\nTogether with guitarist Arian Shafiee, Carlson and Negroponte cultivated a sound that spliced together psychedelic texturing and Krautrock syncopation with the gloss and glow of contemporary pop music. I like to combine as many musical influences as possible, says Negroponte. We thought the sleekness of current radio pop would make our dense wall-of-sound aesthetic both more bizarre and more accessible and fun at the same time. Carlson was similarly inspired by a wide range of artists from around the world after diving deep into obscure 7-inches for her weekly show on Radio Catskill, Rare Pear Radio.\n\nWhile writing the album, Carlson took voice lessons online for the first time. Though she has been singing since she was four years old, at first with a vocal harmony group in her family's church, she hadn't formally trained her voice since joining Guerilla Toss. The lessons allowed her to deepen and broaden her range, helping her feel more embodied and connected to her voice. Underneath ripples of Auto-Tune, playful, searching vocal melodies suspend lyrics about reaching for yourself and holding fast in your own love.\n\nFamously Alive finds Guerilla Toss coming into the fullness of their power, celebrating their prismatic idiosyncrasies from a place of optimism and abundance. It felt like I didn't need to force myself into this dark place to create anymore, Carlson says. For the first time in my life, I feel like I'm finally comfortable inside my body.\n\nThe trio's latest is a beautiful mess of squelchy psych-pop. -- Pitchfork\n\nFINE CHINA SUPERBONE are a noise-\/mathrock outfit from The Netherlands that started out around the year 2000 and soon got a reputation for their manically raging noise\/punk rock shows that were known for disruption and chaos. The release How long is a Chinese (2002) reflects the sound of that period, influenced by bands like Unsane, Dazzling Killmen, and the like. After the vocalist left the band they continued as an instrumental fourpiece.\nNo vocals meant freedom to use more layers and complexity in the songs, of course without losing track of the vintage FINE CHINA SUPERBONE chaos and nervosity, with the guitar riffs twisting and grinding all against each other, and around the quirky patterns laid down by drums and bass. The second release 'Make Machine' (2010) found its way from the famous Next to Jaap studio to the famous Narrominded label.\nSince about 2012, FINE CHINA SUPERBONE are back in the original threepiece form. With a back to basics filthy distorted sound, loads of new riffs and ideas, and the return of the human voice. All of this resulting in a bunch of abrasive, twisted, post noise\/math rock. Nerve racking at times, a little evil; fuckin' nasty, brother! But in the end, no harm is done to your souls; we just like to wrench your gut a little, not kick you out into the dark. No! Have another drink!\nIn 2017 they found themselves playing tighter than ever, and so it was time for another album, which they recorded and mixed in the great city of London in january 2018 with Wayne Adams at his Bear Bites Horse Studio - a place where many other great records were recorded (USA Nails, Death Pedals, N itkowski to name a few). This fine record 'Plaguey' was presented to you by the Geertruida record label. Great cover art was provided, like for previous FCSB releases, by Dutch artist Zeloot.\nAt present they are busy writing material for a new album.\n\nThe current line-up for FINE CHINA SUPERBONE is: Joeri bass, Manfred drums &amp; Wiebe guitar, vocal\n\n+ DJ Pretty\/\/Ugly","link":"","source":"https:\/\/occii.org\/?ical=1"},{"uid":"79938-1663593741@occii.org","start":"05-11-2022 18:00","end":"05-11-2022 21:55","location":"#_LOCATIONNAME, #_LOCATIONFULLLINE, #_LOCATIONCOUNTRY","organizer":null,"title":"SILVER KNIFE (BE\/FR\/NL) + ISKANDR + DE\u00dbLE (FR) + LASSOLAS (FR)","description":"SILVER KNIFE, black metal (be, fr, nl)\n\n\nGrandiose, enchanting black metal.

Starting out in punk rock in the late 70s, his work has evolved into a fusion of experimental Arabic music that incorporates traditional Arabic, shaabi, noise, classical, text, free improvisation, electronics and jazz. He has released 9 solo albums, 6 albums with Shalabi Effect (a free improvisation quartet that bridges Western psychedelic music and Arabic maqam), and 4 albums with Land Of Kush (a 30-member experimental orchestra, for which he composes). He has participated in over 60 albums and has toured Europe, North America and North Africa. His recent projects include albums with Dwarfs Of East Agouza, a Cairo-based trio featuring Alan Bishop and Maurice Louca, albums with Karkhana, a group whose members come from all over the Middle East, and collaborations with singer Nadah El Shazly, Oren Ambarchi, Angel Bat Dawid and a quartet with Brahja Waldman, Liam O Neil and Morgan Moore. He has also composed the music for more than 20 films in North America, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nSince the early 1990s Nicolas Caloia has worked at creating a contemporary music generated by using accurately composed textures to channel collective improvisation. The goal is a music that erases the lines between improvised and composed, pop and avant-garde, good and bad. He hopes this music will satisfy the body, the mind and, above all, the heart.\nHe has worked as a performer, composer, and organizer in Montreal and has toured in North America, Europe, and Asia. He has performed and recorded in a vast array of contexts with the most important members of Montreal's creative music community as well as with internationally renowned musicians like Marshall Allen, John Butcher, Joe McPhee, Steve Lacy, Hassan Hakmoun, Tristan Honsinger and Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia.

Comprising Seattle emcee Onry Ozzborn (Grayskul, Oldominion) and Chicago producer Zavala, DTS has been on the cutting edge of indie hip hop since 2009, behind genre-bending production and a heady lyrical approach all their own. Lore builds on the psych-rap foundation of their previous efforts while shifting into new terrain that incorporates the aesthetics each artist has explored in recent years, and the end product is an album brimming with hope.\nLore explores themes of breaking cycles, self-determination, and rebirth. It contains the most focused and impassioned writing of Onry Ozzborn's two-decade career, and Zavala ties it all together with rich textures, bright synths, and cracking drum breaks.

Ontaard is begonnen als vier vrienden die vooral plezier wilden maken en daarna pas muziek. In een rijke kunstenscene is inspiratie in overvloed. Zo hoor je invloeden uit Sludge, black metal en shoegaze. Ook Franz Kafka, Caspar David Friedrich en Brecht worden aangehaald als inspiratie voor de post-metalband.

In 2020 they attended the Paris writers residency of deBuren, the Flamish-Dutch House for culture and debate and published the chapbook Blijf de kou wegstrijken at Wintertuin Publishers. Their texts appeared i.e. in magazine for literature De Gids and NRC Handelsblad and on platform such as Brainwash Festival, Wintertuinfestival, Nieuwe Types, Perdu and Frontaal.

The two artists started their journey together in October 2021 in Favaios, Portugal, where bread is an essential source of income and a cultural artisanal trade. In the post-pandemic reality of wheat scarcity, the two decided to dive into the socio-political issues around bread baking and work side by side with one of the local bakers named Rosario. The day would start at 4 am, preparing the dough needed to bake 600 loaves of bread a day while sharing stories and local wisdom.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt PuntWG, In&ecirc;s and Asli will present the beginning of their research into the relationship between bread making, cloth and its social economic impacts. Ines will showcase textile studies that imprint the surroundings of Favaios and its bread-making rituals, while reflecting upon cloth as a vessel, a shield and a carrier.&nbsp;Asli will share a work-in-progress video project that documents her participation in the daily routine of the bakery with Rosario.

In the post-pandemic reality of wheat scarcity, the two decided to dive into the socio-political issues around bread baking and work side by side with one of the local bakers named Rosario.

You might enjoy a beer even more if you know a bit about those rich stories. Moreover, Butcher's Tears is dedicated to brewing traditions and reviving them in a modern way. So you'll taste and hear both the 'how' and the 'why'.\n\nWe'll explore beers from some of the most important brewing cultures, the British and the Czech, but also from our very own Dutch grounds. That makes for an interesting tasting with some quite rare beers.  \n\nWhat to think of princessebier for instance? You will know about IPA, a product of the English 18th century drive to bring beer by ship to the Asian colonies. But Holland had something very akin; and even earlier! Beer writer Marco Daane will tell you about these fascinating beers and their trades. And you will taste Butcher's Tears' take on Dutch princessebier and its IPA that mirrors the old English India pale ales.\n\nBeautiful as these beers were, they vanished completely or almost completely. Lager beers from Bavaria and Bohemia took over the beer drinkers world in the 19th century. Nowadays, they've evolved to bland industrial mass products. They make it hardly imaginable that lagers once became preferred to those lovely pale ales. Quite rightly so: these are nowhere near the beers of those early lager days. If you've tasted a proper pilsner, you will understand better why they won the game. Butcher's Tears will show you.\n\nBut not all ales were driven away by lagers. Some IPA's survived and in the British countries much of the daily drinking was and is a matter of pale, bitter or mild ales. Just enter some pub over there to find out. Or better, join our tasting for a glimpse. Together we'll try to find out what it is like to drink either lagers or ales. How come these habits differ from country to country? And what do you prefer?","link":"","source":"https:\/\/calendar.google.com\/calendar\/ical\/t7jfhtk6jhjdmnrah84certbso@group.calendar.google.com\/public\/basic.ics"},{"uid":"7rv2rosmemmqomb8v84oaq3n42@google.com","start":"23-07-2020 17:00","end":"23-07-2020 21:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"ODD with DJ Steve","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/calendar.google.com\/calendar\/ical\/t7jfhtk6jhjdmnrah84certbso@group.calendar.google.com\/public\/basic.ics"},{"uid":"0a5se1uvf43iq3netbr2rq2tte@google.com","start":"17-07-2020 17:00","end":"17-07-2020 22:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"COCKTAIL EXPERIMENT","description":"Join us this Friday at TEARS for a cocktail-experiment night, testing the summer menu. \nA little this and that for \u20ac6,50 a pop, cheap and cheerful. \nstarting at 7pm, alongside DJ neverwenttoartschool \n\n- everyone is welcome -\n\ud83d\ude42","link":"","source":"https:\/\/calendar.google.com\/calendar\/ical\/t7jfhtk6jhjdmnrah84certbso@group.calendar.google.com\/public\/basic.ics"},{"uid":"b9h5csq0st8s9kdc8f863o91qc@google.com","start":"26-09-2020 14:00","end":"27-09-2020 00:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"Happy hour \ud83c\udf82","description":null,"link":"","source":"https:\/\/calendar.google.com\/calendar\/ical\/t7jfhtk6jhjdmnrah84certbso@group.calendar.google.com\/public\/basic.ics"},{"uid":"0ubqbk2shhr3nic65l5rbvh3mc@google.com","start":"03-07-2020 17:00","end":"03-07-2020 22:00","location":null,"organizer":null,"title":"D.J.

Both Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft's Satya Nadella think that the next phase of the mobile internet will be the so-called 'metaverse'--a term often used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet that is made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe. \nCurrently, billions are being invested in its development by companies that benefit from a fully digital future. But while the metaverse seems to be on everyone's lips, it's not here yet. Although the concept of the metaverse dates back to the early 90s, the term gained a lot of traction and growth during the online-everything shift of the pandemic (with Paris Hilton expressing her love for the metaverse back in April 2021). But is a single unified place called 'the metaverse' even possible? Or does it require companies to cooperate in a way that isn't profitable or desirable? And what will be the ecological and material impact of using so much raw computing power to keep a parallel digital world endlessly online? \nDuring tonight's event, together with our three speakers, we'll start to unravel these questions and try to take back the narrative of the metaverse, which companies like Meta are trying to co-opt and own. While the internet came out of public research universities and US government programs, the metaverse will most likely be developed by commercial platforms and companies. With this in mind, it's more crucial than ever that we think carefully about the kind of digital worlds that we want to bring into being. What kind of metaverse do we, as users, really want? Will it be open, privacy-secure, and decentralised? Or will just become another, even more embedded, way for companies to extract our data and sell it back in the form of advertising? Join us as we dive into the complex world of the metaverse to get a better understanding of how it is taking shape around us during this critical moment. \nThe speakers will be announced soon! \nThe Hmm ON ...\n\nThe Hmm ON is a series of hybrid focus events in which we reflect on playful, serious, and sometimes disturbing developments in internet culture. The Hmm ON the Metaverse is physically hosted by Pakhuis de Zwijger (Piet Heinkade 179) in Amsterdam and can be followed on The Hmm livestream.

How can online visitors feel seen, become more involved in or even have agency over what happens on-site? This is something we're going to explore during this workshop. \nTogether with Hackers & Designers we've developed a tool that makes use of standalone wifi hotspots (ESP32 modules) and live networking protocols (MQTT) that allows online input to be translated into something physical, and vice versa. For example, every time an online visitor opens the livestream page, a spotlight shines in the physical space. There are many use cases possible, but how can it help an event really be influenced by the presence of an online audience? How can it stimulate interaction between online and on-site audiences? \nThis workshop doesn't require knowledge of programming. It's free to join, but a registration is required (registration link follows soon). \n\n\nWorkshop set up:\n\n\nWe start at 12:00 with a hybrid session where we show the tool, test it together and brainstorm about valuableand affective implementations.\nAfter a lunch break we continue at 14:00 with a workshop (on-site only) where you learn to develop thistool yourself and get the chance to experiment with it in multipleways.\n\nStuff you need to know:\nDate: Saturday 26 November 2022\nTime: 12:00 - 16:30\nLocation: Page Not Found, Boekhorststraat 126-128, Den Haag\nWhat to bring: a laptop computer (usb adaptor if your computer requires this) and a smartphone.\nYou can join this workshop for free, but a registration is required.\n\nThe workshop is part of First, Then... Repeat. Workshop Scripts in Practice, taking place from 23 November till 27 November 2022 at Page Not Found, The Hague. First, Then.. Repeat is a on- and offline publication that assembles self-published and unpublished workshop scripts that evolved in and around the collective ecosystem of Hackers & Designers.
